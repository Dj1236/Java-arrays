    /* If a class inherits a method from its superclass, then there is a chance to override the method provided that it is not marked final.

Benefit of Overriding in Java
The benefit of overriding is: ability to define a behavior that's specific to the subclass type, which means a subclass can implement a parent class method based on its requirement.

In object-oriented terms, overriding means to override the functionality of an existing method.

Java Method Overriding
Method overriding allows us to achieve run-time polymorphism and is used for writing specific definitions of a subclass method that is already defined in the superclass.

The method is superclass and overridden method in the subclass should have the same declaration signature such as parameters list, type, and return type.

Usage of Java Method Overriding
Following are the two important usages of method overriding in Java:

Method overriding is used for achieving run-time polymorphism.
Method overriding is used for writing specific definition of a subclass method (this method is known as the overridden method). */
